    Creates a bitmap image based on lidar input.
    Assumes rays are equally spaced within the FOV.

    Args:
        scan (list[float]): A list of lidar measurements.

        winding_dir (str): The direction that the rays wind. Must either be CW or CCW in a right handed coord system.
        
        starting_angle (float): The offset from the pos-x axis that points "up" or "forward.
        
        max_scan_radius (float | None): The maximum range expected from the scans. Used to scale the value into the image if given.
        
        scaling_factor (float | None): Scaling factor for the ranges from the scan.
        
        bg_color (str): Either \'white\' or \'black\'. The accent color is always the opposite.

        output_image_dims (tuple[int]): The dimensions of the output image. Should be square but not enforced.
        
        beam_dropout (float): How much of the scan to dropout. I.e., 0 means all beams are drawn, 0.3 means 30% of beams are dropped.
        
        fov (float): The field of view of the car measured in radians. Note: the output will look pinched if this is setup incorrectly.

        draw_mode (str): How should the final image be drawn. Can be \'RAYS\' (view the ray casts - keep beam count low), \'POLYGON\' (draws the outline of the rays), or \'FILL\' (filled in driveable and nondriveable boundary).
